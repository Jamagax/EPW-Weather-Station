EPW Local Weather Station
This project aims to build a functional weather station that can measure and report a number of environmental variables for developing EPW (Energy Plus) weather files.

This project is based on the following arduino projects.


Arduino Weather Station - www.cactus.io
Environmentn Monitor - https://smartcitizen.me/

The aim is to generate EPW files 

The weather station has to capture by it´s own the following data:
Temperature
Relative humidity
Wind speed
Wind direction
Rainfall
Ambient light
UV
Lightning
CO2 levels
SO2 levels
