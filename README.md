## Meteo Stat - EPW Weather Station

EPW Local Weather Station

This project aims to build a functional weather station that can measure and report a number of environmental variables for developing EPW (Energy Plus) weather files.

This project is based on the following arduino projects.


Arduino Weather Station - www.cactus.io

Environmentn Monitor - https://smartcitizen.me/

The aim is to generate EPW files 

The weather station has to capture by it´s own the following data:

Temperature

Relative humidity

Wind speed

Wind direction

Rainfall
Ambient light

UV

Lightning

CO2 levels

SO2 levels
